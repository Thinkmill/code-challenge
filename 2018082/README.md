August 2018 challenge (part two)
=====================

This months _second_ challenge consists of you writing two [sorting algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm) from scratch.
This folder contains a json file `unsorted.json`.
In that file we can find an object with two arrays: `heroes` and `villains`.
Each of those need to be sorted alphabetically.
`heroes` need to be sorted via the [selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort) algorithm.
`villains` need to be sorted via the [merge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) algorithm.

## RULEZ

1. Node only
1. No dependencies
1. No use of `sort`
